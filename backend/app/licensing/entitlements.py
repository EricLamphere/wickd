"""Entitlement resolution: is this installation currently allowed to use Pro
features? Wraps polar_client with a persistent grace-period cache so Pro
features keep working through brief offline periods / Polar outages, while
still requiring a fresh successful check periodically so a canceled
subscription doesn't stay entitled forever just by going offline.

Design (per project decision — see conversation history, not re-litigated
here): grace period, not fail-open or fail-closed. A definitive "no" from
Polar (LicenseKeyNotEntitled — confirmed via sandbox testing to be how a
canceled subscription's key actually behaves, see polar_client.py) is always
trusted immediately, regardless of the grace period; the grace period only
protects against not being able to REACH Polar at all.
