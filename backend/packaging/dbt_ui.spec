# PyInstaller spec for the dbt-ui backend, bundled as a Tauri resource.
#
# Build with:
#   cd backend && .venv/bin/pyinstaller packaging/dbt_ui.spec --distpath dist --workpath build --noconfirm
#
# dbt and git are intentionally NOT bundled — they remain external tools the
# user must already have on PATH, invoked via subprocess (see .claude/rules/dbt-execution.md).
#
# Built as --onedir (EXE + COLLECT), not onefile: onefile re-extracts the
# entire interpreter and libraries into a fresh temp dir on every single
# launch, which added ~7s to app startup. onedir keeps everything unpacked
# on disk permanently, so launching is just exec + dynamic-library load.
# Tauri's externalBin/sidecar mechanism only accepts a single file, so the
# resulting dbt-ui-backend/ folder is shipped as a plain Tauri "resource"
# and spawned directly (see src-tauri/src/lib.rs) instead of via .sidecar().

# PyInstaller one-file binary fork-bombs, because ensurepip's bootstrap
# re-execs "python", which resolves to this whole frozen app rather than a
# real interpreter. See app/dbt/venv.py.
